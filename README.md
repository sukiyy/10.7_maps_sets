# 10.7_maps_sets

Maps and Sets
Unlike programming languages like Python and Java, JavaScript comes with only a few built-in Data Structures. ES2015 tackled this issue by adding in two data structures common in other languages: maps and sets. 

In this subunit, we'll teach you what you need to know to get up and running with these two data structures. You'll learn what they are, how to use them, and what kinds of problems they are best suited for. At the end of the subunit, we'll have a few exercises for you to complete.
